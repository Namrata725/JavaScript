# Javascript: Conditional statement

====================================================================================================

## *Types of conditional statement in JS ##

### 1. `if` Statement
Executes a block of code **only if** the condition evaluates to `true`.

### 2. `if...else` Statement
Executes one block if the condition is `true`, and another if it is `false`.

### 3. `if...else if...else` Statement
Checks multiple conditions in sequence. Executes the first block where the condition is `true`.

### 4. `switch` Statement
Used to perform different actions based on different possible values of a single expression (e.g., a variable). It is often used as a cleaner alternative to many `else if` statements.
