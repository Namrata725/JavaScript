# JavaScript: Functions

### **overview**

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are executed when they are called or invoked.

==========================================================================================

### **why functions**
- To organize logic into manageable blocks.
- To avoid repeating code.
- To make code reusable and modular.
- To improve maintainability and readability of code.

==========================================================================================

### **where we use functions**
- For performing repetitive tasks.
- To handle events (like clicks or form submissions).
- In asynchronous operations (like fetching data).
- While working with arrays, objects, and APIs.

## Types of Functions in JavaScript

### `Regular Function`  
Traditional function declaration using the `function` keyword. It can be named or anonymous and is hoisted, meaning it can be called before its declaration.

*Used for defining reusable logic blocks.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### `Arrow Function`  
Introduced in ES6. A concise syntax that does **not bind its own `this`**, making it useful in callbacks and functional programming.

*Best for short functions and callbacks.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### `Callback Function`  
A function passed as an argument to another function. It is called later, typically after an operation completes or an event occurs.

*Used in event handling, asynchronous programming, and array methods.*
